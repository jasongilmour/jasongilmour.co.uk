title: "Binodi"
introduction: Biondi is a high fashion beachwear brand based in Chelsea. I developed the existing brand and web presence into a cohesive brand that would cover their Boutique, Collection and Showroom sub-brands (ecommerce website, bespoke beachwear and wholesale distributor respectively).
secondintroduction: Moving forward from their existing "Biondi Couture" brand I developed three complimentary yet unique sub-brands to help solidify each one in their respective markets. Each brand communicates luxury and high fashion while adapting to the nuances their respective audiences.
