title: "HailTo"
introduction: The entertainment industry has an vast amount of untapped social reach in the form of their on-screen Talent. Stars of shows and movies often have many times the social reach and engagement of the official social accounts for the shows and movies they are in. This presents a huge opportunity to efficiently boost marketing clout on social. At <a href="https://stormideas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Storm Ideas</a>, we built <a href="https://hailto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HailTo</a> to tap into this reach - using our unique combination of domain knowledge, pragmatic design and the latest technologies.

		<p>My role in creating HailTo was to lead the design of our new product, from inception and definition, through the first release and beyond.</p>
		<p>Initially I worked closely with the founder of Storm Ideas on the first prototypes, sketching out the potential branding and aesthetics, features, and user flows. Our Creative Director played a vital role in steering the aesthetics, branding and marketing assets in the right direction, while my focus was on the UX.</p>
		<p>Towards the end of the first design sprints and during production, I worked closely with our development team to ensure that the design implementation would be as good as possible, and we could solve any new design problems as soon as they came up.</p>

		<h2>Product definition and use cases</h2>
		<p>The idea for the product came from Storm Ideas' experience of working closely with the US entertainment industry for a number of years on a variety of digital and marketing projects. This allowed us to identify some key areas that we thought would have the most opportunity to improve our clients workflows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Requesting media from Talent to be shared on official social accounts.</li>
			<li>Requesting that Talent share the latest assets and PR material.</li>
			<li>Make official assets easily available to Talent.</li>
			<li>In app support for Talent, in a way that makes the app as flexible as possible, and could identify pain points and potential opportunities for improvement.</li>
			<li>Provide a hub for existing social teams to be able to work more efficiently with Talent.</li>
			<li>Improve communication between Talent and Social Media teams.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>User Personas</h2>
		<h3>Social media manager</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Primary user of the admin interface.</li>
			<li>Vital point of contact for Talent.</li>
			<li>Used to juggling multiple social channels.</li>
			<li>Has to organise a lot of assets.</li>
			<li>Has to co-ordinate across social properties.</li>
			<li>HailTo should combine existing workflows seamlessly for this user.</li>
			<li>It's a priority for this user that HailTo improves meaningful social reach of the whole organisation.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Business Executive</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Uses both the admin interface and app.</li>
			<li>Time poor.</li>
			<li>Not a primary user but a key stakeholder.</li>
			<li>Must be able understand the value proposition quickly.</li>
			<li>HailTo should prove that it's valuable for co-ordination between marketing and talent.</li>
			<li>It's a priority for this user that HailTo improves meaningful social reach of the whole organisation.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Talent</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Primary app user.</li>
			<li>Time poor.</li>
			<li>Likes to see and share their own work.</li>
			<li>Very concerned about privacy and security.</li>
			<li>Wants to increase their social media following.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We were very familiar with the tools used by the social media managers, so this was a great starting point for our competitor analysis. Best of breed enterprise software had already solved a lot of the problems we'd face while designing the admin interface, so we found a lot of inspiration here.</p>
		<p>There were also a lot of existing paradigms that the app should fit to boost immediate familiarity and trust - it should feel like the social media apps that the user is most familiar with. This is why we began by taking inspiration from feeds and notifications found on social networks to make the process of sharing from HailTo as familiar as possible.</p>

			<li>Upload/manage assets for Talent to access.</li>
			<li>Request sharing of assets.</li>
			<li>Request media from Talent.</li>
			<li>Provide support for Talent from within the admin.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>App</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Login and authentication.</li>
			<li>Browse/share relevant assets.</li>
			<li>Create and send content to social media managers to be used in official campaigns.</li>
			<li>Get content to share on social media.</li>
			<li>Liaise with social media managers.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Design</h2>
		<p>We began working on HailTo with quite a clear idea of the problems we wanted to solve and how the product would fit in to the ecosystem of enterprise workflows, social media, marketing, and smartphones. This gave us the architecture that our product should fit into, and defined the shape of a solution that would be familiar enough to encourage adoption. A PWA Admin interface for the social media managers, and a smartphone app for Talent.</p>
		<h3>Admin Interface</h3>
		<p>This was my first experience of designing an entire admin interface, so I was pretty excited to get started. Having an attitude of "design to learn" seems to have been useful here, as it kept experiments open ended enough to continually accelerate the process and then next flow or screen I'd design always started better than the last.</p>
		<p>It was also the first time I started by prototyping in HTML. Starting from a library of common admin interface components and pages allowed us to get 80% of the way to a working solution with 20% of the work. It also allowed us to get very close to an MVP and use this as a robust starting point on which to iterate.</p>
		<p>Seeing HTML prototypes early on with sample data and working navigation really crystallises what changes need to be made to the Information Architecture, what flows should use common components, what patterns may be familiar, and how we can get the data required to run the app. It really forces holistic, system thinking from the start which has proven to be hugely beneficial down the line in terms of aiding development of new features that can build on and tweak existing components and patterns.</p>
		<p>Of course, it also gave us a big head start with font-end dev.</p>

		<h2>Mobile App</h2>
		<p>We knew early on that there would be 4 key areas of the app that would cover our use cases:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Share: Talent would find a feed of requests to share official content to their own social media accounts.</li>
			<li>Make: Talent would be asked to create content that could be used by the official social accounts of their show, and repurposed for marketing assets.</li>
			<li>Browse:  where they would have access to photos, videos and GIFs that they could share and use spontaneously.</li>
			<li>Chat: for support using the app and anything else.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We also had two priorities in the first phase of design: bring familiarity to a new concept, and make the app feel trustworthy, secure, and private.</p>

			<figcaption>Early sketches considering what data could be useful in the app, and what familiar components could make sense</figcaption>
		</div>
		<p>This led us to begin by experimenting with what existing patterns could be adapted to work for our specific use cases. We used the idea of a feed for share requests, tags for sorting assets, an inbox style layout for make requests and a dark interface to help give the impression of privacy.</p>

		</div>
		<p>Not much remains from these initial designs, as we simplified them to remove a lot of unnecessary clutter. We reduced the number of states used for components to avoid confusion, refined the layout and typography, and improved the information density based on how we thought the app would really be used.</p>

		<h3>Branding and Marketing</h3>
		<p>This was the most collaborative part of the project among the creative team at Storm Ideas. While I worked on some concepts, colour schemes, typography, and logos - everyone in the creative team made their mark on the project.</p>
		<p>One of the key challenges was in clearly communicating the value of HailTo on the marketing website. Initially we used the slogan "Unleash your Talent" and created diagrams to explain the core functionality of the product. This has been continually refined to better show off HailTo.</p>

		<hr />

		<h2>Workflow & tools</h2>
		<p>There was a couple of challenges in the workflow while designing the app.</p>
		<p>We used HailTo as an opportunity to test out a new design tool, Figma. This had a small learning curve in getting used to the controls after years of using Adobe products - but the biggest change was in the transparency and collaboration that Figma allows. Design files are accessible by everyone involved in the project by default, and anyone can make changes to them.</p>
		<p>This was great for allowing us to work towards having a "Single Source of Truth" but in reality it's never that simple. There's a trade off to be made between developing the best solutions as fast as possible and having a perfect, organised and comprehensive design file.</p>

		<hr />

		<h2>Production</h2>
		<h3>Admin Interface</h3>
		<p>Moving from using <a href="https://github.com/HosseinKarami/fastshell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fastshell</a> for HTML prototypes to building a React webapp probably best marks the transition between design and production. We're not in the habit of "throwing designs over the wall" to developers, so it was possibly also one of the steepest learning curves of my career. This was the first time I'd seen an arrow function, used ES6, or used React and Webpack - but after an embarrassingly long time spent tying to work out why I'm staring at a red error screen, we came to a pretty good balance where I could sketch out new React components using the HTML and styles from the prototypes to be connected to real data later.</p>
		<p>Learning how to work with React also allowed me to make changes to production code without having to create HTML to be handed over and deployed later, speeding up the build process further still.</p>
		<p>It also allowed us to codify our design decisions, the best example of this is in the form components used throughout the admin interface. Forms are vital in any admin interface, but they're also a solved problem with fairly limited complexity and well understood best practices. We created a collection of React components that make form elements using simple props to speed up the front end build, and guide the developer to create forms with a good UX from the start.</p>
		<p>For example, we have a variety of components ranging from a generic text input to a phone number input. Each one accepts props for label, placeholder, help text, validation messages, basic layout options and more. Some props are required and many have sensible defaults - like whether or not it's a required input.</p>
		<p>These are one good example of a component set up in a way that describes a consistent design system from within the code.</p>

		</div>

		<h3>Mobile App</h3>
		<p>The design and build of the mobile app had far more overlaps. We had to strike a balance between time spent on the admin and keeping development of the app unblocked. We also had to balance what we considered the best implementation of a feature, and what would allow us to build it quickly, eg. where we could use native app controls rather than creating a custom component like a photo picker.</p>
		<p>Being able to work so closely with our iOS developer to understand the cost of any design decisions allowed us to far better prioritise feature development, and focus design resources on areas that would be the most beneficial to the product.</p>

		<h2>Fast Follows</h2>
		<p>After an initial period of improving reliability and paying off technical debt, it was time for some improvements. We had some ideas for features we wanted to add, and combined this with some initial usage data and user feedback to prioritise some fast follows.</p>
		<p>It was clear that the Assets section was the most heavily used part of the system, so this was our focus for fast follows. Managing files is, for the most part, a solved problem - however we have a fairly unique use case providing opportunity for improving and streamlining the experience.</p>
		<p>One of the first things we noticed was that tags weren't being used. We initially imagined assets being tagged with things like who's in them, what episode and series they were from, where they were taken etc. So, we decided to try automating some organisation by building in facial recognition.</p>
		<p>Being able to notify Talent when an asset featuring them was uploaded was a feature we wanted to add early on, and was requested by the client. This tied in nicely with the facial recognition so was also prioritised.</p>

		<hr />

		<h2>What's next</h2>
		<p>As with any large, complex product - there's still room for improvement. One area I feel that I overlooked is in onboarding of the admin interface. Not everyone using it will have had the pitch that the stakeholders had before deciding to use HailTo - so I think we could do a better job of communicating the value and power of HailTo from within the admin.</p>
		<p>The app has also grown a lot since designing the current onboarding flows, so a more considered approach to logging in and managing settings could help here too.</p>

		<hr />

		<h2>Other considered solutions</h2>
		<p>I briefly explored the idea to base the app on a chat interface. It occurred to me that much of the user flows could be efficiently completed by using a conversation as the hub of the app. With chat bots and chat based interfaces like Cleo becoming ever more common, this could become a suitable paradigm for interactions with HailTo. I also think that a chat based interface would be very well suited to an app like HailTo with such specific use cases.</p>
