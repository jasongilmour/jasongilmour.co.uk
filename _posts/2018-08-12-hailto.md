We were very familiar with the tools used by the social media managers, so this was a great starting point for our competitor analysis. Best of breed enterprise software had already solved a lot of the problems we'd face designing the admin interface, so we found a lot of inspiration here.

There were also a lot of existing paradigms that the app should fit to boost immediate familiarity and trust. It had to be as seamless as possible to make sharing from the app frictionless. So we drew from ideas like feeds from social networks and tried to keep the process of sharing as familiar as possible to remove friction.

## Design

### Marketing
Producing a vision
ROI (minimal investment, basic presence)
Not my strong point

### Admin
Rapid prototyping with HTML (I learned a lot here)
Requirements/flows -> IA -> Interface (page)
Walking the line between good and easy
An invaluable prototype (the best build spec - fastshell)

### App
Learning a new tool while I'm at it (Figma)
The source of truth is a lie
Designing for a very specific audience
Using familiarity
Controlling friction
Feeling secure

## Production (MVP)

### Admin
No hand-off
More learning (react and all the things)
Forgetting fundamentals (progressive enhancement, accessibility and react)
Describing the design system in the code
Everything is a system (react components are the best)

### App
The path of least resistance (we need to get the product out, what can the technology help with)
Learning from the developer (relates to above)

## Production (Fast Follows)
Reliability
User feedback
Optional features (chat)
Admin optimizations (so many!)

## What's next
