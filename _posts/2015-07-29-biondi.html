title: "Binodi"
introduction: Biondi is a high fashion beachwear brand based in Chelsea. I developed the existing brand and web presence into a cohesive brand that would cover their Boutique and Collection and Showroom (wholesale) sub-brands, each of which is adapted to be more suitable for their varied target audiences.
secondintroduction: Moving forward from their existing "Biondi Couture" brand I developed three complimentary yet unique sub-brands to help solidify each aspects position in their respective markets. Each brand exudes luxury and high fashion while remaining faithful to the nuances of each slightly different market space.
