introduction: Biondi is a high fashion beachwear brand based in Chelsea. I developed the existing brand and web presence into a cohesive brand that would cover their Boutique and Collection and Showroom (wholesale) sub-brands, each of which is adapted to be more suitable for their varied target audiences.
