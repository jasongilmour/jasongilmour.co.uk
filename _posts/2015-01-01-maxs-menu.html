title: "Max's Menu"
introduction: Max's Bar and Grill is a vibrant venue in the heart of Glasgow. They were looking to modernize &amp; enhance their customers ordering experience by creating a digital menu. I created a beautiful interface for this menu that compliments the Max's brand and helps showcase the dishes on offer.
