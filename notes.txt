Narrative :-

	My creative process relies on solid strategy, knowledge of context and clear goals.
	My work speaks for itself.

Project details
	- Biondi
		Biondi is a high fashion beachwear brand based in Chelsea. I developed the existing brand and web presence into a cohesive brand that would cover their Boutique and Collection and Showroom (wholesale) sub-brands, each of which is adapted to be more suitable for their varied target audiences.

		Biondi Boutique captures the essence of the physical store and creates an open & welcoming digital experience

		Biondi Collection puts the products front & center to showcase the luxuary.

		Biondi Showroom gives an exclusive and regal edge to the brands it represents.

		Moving forward from their existing "Biondi Couture" brand I developed three complimentary yet unique sub-brands to help solidify each aspects position in their respective markets. Each brand exudes luxury and high fashion while remaining faithful to the nuances of each slightly different market space.

		The web presence of each brand was also refreshed, by applying the new brand to their large ecommerce store and creating two new, fully response websites.


	- Chamonix (student project)
		Chamonix is the Mountain Sports capital of Europe. Located in the French Alps at the foot of Mt Blanc, it caters for hundreds of thousands of tourists and outdoors enthusiasts all year round.

		This project is a concept for the branding, marketing and design of an app to enhance the experience of visiting Chamonix. To achieve this we produced a modern & recognisable aesthetic that sat well in the tourism and adventure sport scenes.
	
	- Local Pinboard
		Local Pinboard is the new, local social network. It aims to bring communities closer together by providing a digital platform for users to discuss local issues, promote and share local businesses and buy & sell within the community.

		I led the design for Local Pinboard from initial branding & marketing concepts through to UI & UX design and front end development.

		The branding was developed to be versatile, using the pin icon that will be recognisable in a variety of contexts, friendly typography and aesthetics to appeal to a wide audience and illustrated characters to help communicate the sites value.
	
	- Max's Menu
		Max's Bar and Grill is a vibrant venue in the heart of Glasgow. They approached Greenhill looking to modernize & enhance their customers ordering experience by creating a digital menu. I created a beautiful interface for this menu that compliments the Max's brand showcases the dishes.
	
	- Nike (student project)
		An impatful advertising campaign to launch the new Mercurial football boot that riffs on the idea of light to communicate key product features. The boot is designed to be as quick and light weight as possible to enhance footballers explosive speed and give a "barefoot feel". The light metaphor ties the weight and speed of the boot together nicely and the semi-transparent effect plays on the idea of the barefoot feel while adding a nice, visceral aestheyic.
	
	- Semd's Miracle Brew (personal project)
		I wanted to enhance some home made liquors by adding a novelty aesthetic and some more fun the bottling process. The label was inspired by Big Audio Dynamite’s hit 1980′s song, "Medicine Show" and given a fitting aesthetic with some suitable adapted lyrics to help sell the product.
